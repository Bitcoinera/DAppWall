<h2> Inspiration </h2>

<p>To create a safe net in the DAppNode</p>

  <h2> What it does </h2>
  
<p>
The basic functionality of DAppWall is to create a centralized system of access that will be register on a immutable net of nodes from DAppNode at which you could connect to.

DAppWall will follow a system of social acceptance where the community will decide which nodes won't go to the black list and which one will. In other words , each node decides which nodes go to its black and white list , this lists will be added to the community one , the one DAppWall will feed from to create its firewall.

  <b> How we built it </b>
</summary>
<details>
<p>
The objective it is to build it with react for the front end , for back end we will use the ip tables , a smart-contract.
We will also bundle our DApp to be able to work with DAppNode , and it will be an Aragon DAO.

Creating the DAO has been really the main issue setting up the smart-contracts has caused us problems too due to the complexity of the rules we were trying to set up.
