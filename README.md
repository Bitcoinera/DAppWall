## Inspiration

To create a safe net in the DAppNode

## What it does

The basic functionality of DAppWall is to create a centralized system of access that will be register on a immutable net of nodes from DAppNode at which you could connect to. 

DAppWall will follow a system of social acceptance where the community will decide which nodes won't go to the black list and which one will. In other words , each node decides which nodes go to its black and white list , this lists will be added to the community one , the one DAppWall will feed from to create its firewall.

## How we built it

The objective it is to build it with react for the front end , for back end we will use the ip tables , a smart-contract.
We will also bundle our DApp to be able to work with DAppNode , and it will be an Aragon DAO.

## Challenges we ran into

Creating the DAO has been really the main issue setting up the smart-contracts has caused us problems too due to the complexity of the rules we were trying to set up.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning about Aragon and all its process and sending packages to the DAppNode. 

## What we learned

No matter the objective , the only thing that will make the difference is the the tenacity of the group.

## What's next for DAppWall

We plan to polish as much as possible this idea to bring it to life with the best structure we can imagine.
